We must create. That is the sign of our times.

Inventing is making things that are parallel in space, meet in time or vice versa, so that they present a new fact in their conjunction.

The totality of the diverse new facts united by a single spirit constitutes the created work. 
If they are not united by a single spirit, the result will be an impure work with an amorphous look, resulting from a fantasy with no laws.

The study of art throughout history shows us clearly this tendency of imitation to move towards creation in all human productions.

In art the power of the creator interests us more than that of the observer, and besides the former contains in itself the second, to a higher degree.
