The Cubists want to cover Dada with snow; that may surprise you, but it is so, they want
to empty the snow from their pipe to bury Dada.
Are you sure?
Perfectly sure, the facts are revealed by grotesque mouths. They think that Dada can
prevent them from practicing this odious trade: Selling art expensively.
Art costs more than sausages, more than women, more than everything.
Art is visible like God! (see Saint-Sulpice.)
Art is a pharmaceutical product for imbeciles.
The tables turn thanks to spirit; the paintings and other works of art are like strong-box
tables, the spirit is inside and becomes more and more inspired according to the auction prices.
Farce, farce, farce, farce, farce, my dear friends.
Dealers do not like painting, they recognize the mystery of spirit ...
Buy copies of autographs.
Don't be snobs, you will never be less intelligent because your neighbor possesses
something exactly like yours.
No more fly specks on the walls.
There will be some anyway, that's clear, but a few less.
Dada is certainly going to become less and less detested, its police-pass will permit it to
bypass processions chanting "Come, Ducky," what a sacrilege!
Cubism represents the dearth of ideas.
They have cubed paintings of the primitives, cubed Negro sculptures, cubed violins,
cubed guitars, cubed the illustrated newspapers, cubed shit, and the profiles of young girls, how
they must cube money!!!
Dada itself wants nothing, nothing, nothing, it's doing something so that the public can
say: "We understand nothing, nothing, nothing."
The Dadaists are nothing, nothing, nothing-certainly they will come to nothing, nothing,
nothing.
