You can judge how bad the seventies were by looking at its uptight architecture.

A democracy of opinion polls and complacency thrives behind Biedermeier façades.
We have no desire to build Biedermeier. Not now or no other time. 
We are tired of seeing Palladio and other historical masks. Because with architecture, 
we don’t want to exclude everything that is disquieting.

We want architecture that has more. Architecture that bleeds, that exhausts, that whirls, and even breaks.
Architecture that lights up, stings, rips, and tears under stress.
Architecture has to be cavernous, fiery, smooth, hard, angular, brutal, round, delicate, 
colorful, obscene, lustful, dreamy, attracting, repelling, wet, dry, and throbbing. Alive or dead.

If cold, then cold as a block of ice.
If hot, then hot as a blazing wing.
Architecture must blaze.
